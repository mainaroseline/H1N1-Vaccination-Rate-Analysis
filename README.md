Our Client is a medical organization situated in Reno,Nevada. The organization works hand in hand with the government when it comes to the distribution of medical supplies including vaccines within the Reno city in Nevada. From the recent outbreak of the Corona Virus and the recent developments which led to the discovery of the vaccine,the organization wants to get a better understanding of how the general population will respond to the vaccine and how likely individuals are to get vaccinated.

## Business Understanding
Since data on Covid-19 is not readily available, The medical organization wants you to use past data on H1N1 influenza virus which is on different peopleâ€™s backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors. Using the data on H1N1 vaccine they want you to determine: 

1. if more people got vaccinated or not vaccinated
2. which age group is most likely to get vaccinated, 
3. the impact a doctors reccomendation has on a respondent's decision on whether to get vaccinated or not 
4. the distribution of vaccination by gender. 
5. They also want you to come up with an algorithm that can predict whether someone got the H1N1 vaccine. 

From this they hope to get a better understanding of how these characteristics have been associated with personal vaccination patterns and will provide guidance for future public health efforts.

## Data Understanding and Methodology
For the project we were provided with data on over 10,000 individuals  and the characteristics associated with personal vaccination patterns.
Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.The data was split into:
- Training Features : This contained the training input/independent variables. It has 36 columns.
- Training Labels : This contained the training target/dependant variables. It has 2 columns h1n1_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine of the binary variable types.In our anaysis i will be using the H1N1 vaccine target variable only.
- Test Features: This contained the test input/independent variable. It has 36 columns. But there weren't any target/dependent variable for the test features

For the analysis i performed Exploratory analysis, built and evaluated some classification models

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### The Distribution of the Target Labels
